add role www

add IoT rules:
- role: www, rule: rebroadcast /devices/send/broadcast to /www/receive/broadcast
- role: IoTThing, rule: rebroadcast /devices/send/broadcast to /devices/receive/broadcast
- create v3 of a policy -- figure out how to do versioning
-- also figure out if I can store the policy outside of the cloud formation template

-- setup a device that i can control system by making a free online call to a service...
--- voice controlled triggered build would be cool
